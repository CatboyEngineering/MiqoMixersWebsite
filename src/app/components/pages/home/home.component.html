<p>
  KinkShell is a plugin for
  <strong>Final Fantasy: XIV</strong>
  allowing users to sync up and enjoy roleplaying with the aid of connected toys.
</p>
<p class="mt-2">
  Invite others to your private shell to exchange a few words - or deeds. Give others permission to touch you back, or let them know who's really in
  control.

</div>

<p>
  Connect your toys, join your shell, and start talking. KinkShell handles the hard stuff so you can too. It even works cross-world or
  cross-datacenter, helping you close the gap even further.

</div>

<p>
  Designed to be discreet, private, and secure, KinkShell protects your intimate moments with modern SSL encryption running on our own servers. Nobody
  else knows who you're talking with or what you're saying, and only those you're connected to can see what toys you're using. You can rest easy
  knowing that what happens in the shell stays there.

<p>Playing is easy, and so is taking a break. You always have control over what your toys are doing.</p>
